# Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses a logistic regression model to identify customers who are at high risk of churning.  
It includes techniques for handling imbalanced data (SMOTE), feature selection, threshold tuning, and deployment simulation.

## Key Features
- Logistic Regression
- SMOTE oversampling
- Business constraints integration (contacting limit)
- Model evaluation (confusion matrix, ROC AUC, etc.)

## Files
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory analysis and model training
- `data/`: Sample training data (if shareable)
- `src/`: Custom Python scripts for modeling
